FEATURES

- all the places ticker is entered, how do we track it
- record note on AMD $49 escape and sell of $47 without getting assigned

LONG TERM

- weekly review email 
- daily movement summary
- automated stock analysis/reviews -- need more details

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

- notes badge on stock details that can be expanded and shows notes you have for the stock
- review endpoint, dates on each note, price of share at the time of the note, separate each note
- notes, fill with share information when note is made
- import validation (size, contents, headers)
- login tracking
- reuse transaction component for rendering transaction list
- indicate expired option in option details, do not allow to buy/sell
- user ip address is not used anywhere
- empty state: 
    clicking from stock detail to notes, loads nothing
- user delete post processing to wipe out info
- what happens when you try to record a sell before you had a buy
- loading indicator when stock is looked up on the front page, it can take a while

DESIGN
- custom bootstrap components for dropdowns, dates
- market cap/gross profit, should all be rounded
- fundamentals section should be a card layout
- share buy/sell is a disaster from UX/usability/flow standpoint

BUGS
- redis keys are nonsensical
- option dates seem to be off, it should not be a single date
- int for money amounts
- review how we track partial share sales
- how to correct this whole "key" vs "ticker" on events..
- export of options, amount sometimes is zero

INFRA
- badges for builds/coverage
- practice use of polly
- terraform or pulumi for infrastructure
- check into https://www.nuget.org/packages/Respawn/
- export as excel sheet
- k8s for managing container switches
- nullability in the project

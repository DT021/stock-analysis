DESIGN

- market cap/gross profit, should all be rounded
- fundamentals section should be a card layout
- share buy/sell is a disaster from UX/usability/flow standpoint

BUGS

- review how we track partial share sales
- how to correct this whole "key" vs "ticker" on events..
- export of options, amount sometimes is zero
